# Game Overview

`Escape Room: Hogwarts Edition` is a text-based escape room style game you can play in your computer's terminal all themed as if you are locked in a room at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy.

In your first week of school, you spend the night in a new friend's dorm and wake up to realize they pulled a prank on you. You have an hour to make it to your first class and you must solve a series of puzzles to break the spell. Do you have what it takes to break the spell? Or will you be stuck waiting for a professor to save you?
